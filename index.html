        <h2 class="motivation_description">Control of your destiny</h2>
        This course opens up many opportunities for a novice programmer. 
        Learning to code opens up many opportunities for me. 
        Whether I decide to learn how to create websites, games or Android applications - when I learn the basics, I can start creating my own projects almost immediately.

        <h2 class="motivation_description">Growing demand for programmers</h2>
        The growing demand in this field means that many companies are still "fighting" for programmers, tempting them with higher and higher salaries.
        However the situation in the IT industry is different from that in other industries.
        Due to staff shortages, employers are often willing to hire beginner Juniors, whom they willingly train for more advanced projects.

        <h2 class="motivation_description">Develop interpersonal skills</h2>
        Coding will not only improve my technical skills but also help improve my soft skills.    
        Most of the time when I work in a team, I have to collaborate with other co-workers, 
        I may need to discuss a project with them, I need to interact with them, 
        and all these things will eventually develop my soft skills, which not only helps in building good relationships in professional as well as personal life.

        <h2 class="why_header">Patience and meticulousness</h2>
        <p class="why_element">
        Writing code requires long and quite monotonous work. It often takes a long time to see the visible effect. My forte is patience.
        </p> 
        <h2 class="why_header">Self-development and curiosity</h2>
        <p class="why_element">Software development is a creative process that sometimes requires creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
           Curiosity is what drives them. Curiosity is the trait that best suits me
        </p> 
        <h2 class="why_header">Open to constructive criticism</h2>
        <p class="why_element">This is a very important feature that will determine not only the quality of cooperation in the group, 
            but also the client's experience and his final opinion about the company in which we work. 
            The code we write will never be perfect. That's why I'm not afraid of constructive criticism.
        </p> 
        <h2 class="why_header">Teamwork</h2>
        <p class="why_element">Much more can be achieved in a team than alone, which is why the work of programmers takes this form.
         I have many years of experience working in a team.
        </p> 
        <h2 class="why_header">Quick problem solving</h2>
        <p class="why_element">This job is primarily about efficient problem solving, 
           learning from your mistakes and looking for solutions that would repair the damage done. 
           I am no stranger to problem solving.
